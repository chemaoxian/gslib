code in:
F:\Temp\gslib\gslib
about "iocp"
still need to be merged.

1.canvas -> painter
2.painter was the original canvas, support basic image operations
3.raster: painter, support path paint operations
4.rose: raster.  to implement a raster on shader engine
5.the scene design should be smart, thinks about an situation:
	that the ui was transparent, and the scene below ui was changed, how to paint ui?
	absolutely we won't render the ui again, what we need was actuallly 2 swapeff in the swap chain,
	change the ui layer, then do alpha mix
6.so the first step was not to implement or join the original canvas system, but to join the scene with	
	the framesys. then with the rendersys. we need to draw it

libuuid sucks, give up.
I will implement a uuid generator myself, doesn't seems to be hard.
In this case, the gslib will not depend on boost anymore.

1.split_patch时要拆分子多边形并分配到合适的节点下
2.clip_result的结果顺时针逆时针
3.clip_result转painter_path
4.clip_pivot, 多重交点
5.xor，需要补全or, and

此外两个重要算法的实现
1.constrained delauney triangulation
2.loop blinn
3.自己的make方案
